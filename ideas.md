# List of ideas for fun projects and maybe some other good things too

## Procedural graffiti
Algorithms to procedurally generate colorful graffiti pieces. 
- What domain to use? Procedural methods or high level machine learning
- Base on existing art or try to make it similar on its own?

## Fractals engine
An "engine" where the user can customize fractal patterns with a GUI for a preview shot, then ray trace fine details
- Throw in computer graphics methods
- Use as learning project for cg

## Space ship tunnel game
3D game where you steer a ship sideways as it goes foward in a tunnel, avoiding obstacles
- Star wars theme?
- WebGL + three.js?
